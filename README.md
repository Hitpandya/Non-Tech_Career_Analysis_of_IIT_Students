# Non-Tech_Career_Analysis_of_IIT_Students
 
Data analysis and interactive Excel dashboard showing IIT students’ interest in non-tech roles (Product Management, Data Analytics, Finance, Consulting, etc.).

## Project Overview
This repo contains the raw data and the final dashboard used to analyze how many IIT students prepare for non-tech careers. It includes data collection, transformation, and a polished Excel dashboard.

## Workflow
1. **Data collection:** Google Form responses aggregated into CSV.  
2. **Data transformation:** Cleaning, normalization, role parsing, and preparation for visualization.  
3. **Visualization:** Interactive Excel dashboard with slicers, filters and charts.

## Key Insights
- Product Management and Data Analytics are the most commonly targeted non-tech roles.
- Students from top IITs show higher exposure to non-tech profiles.
